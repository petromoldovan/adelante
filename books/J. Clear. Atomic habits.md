# Atomic habits
# Ch1 Power of atomic habits
* 1% rule - make one percent progress every day. Make sure to do smth every day that makes you 1% better.
You will progress in a compounded matter, per year you will have more than 365% because you do smth every day.
* Be patient. Small changes often make no result until certain threshold. 
* Forget about setting goals. Focus on your system and you will get results. You are only as good as your system.

# Ch2 How habits shape your identity
* Three levels of layers of behaviour change:
- outcome: you set some goals and achieve them. But you do not change yourself
- process: you change the system how you operate to achieve outcomes.
- identity: change you beliefs. Ask yourself what kind of person gets the goals(finance, relationships etc) that you want?
Become that person and you will achieve the outcomes automatically.
* Your identity are your habits and vice verse. Every action you take is some sort of confirmation of your identity. If you 
take only good actions, you will start believing that you are a good person. For example, ask yourself all the time
what would a healthy person do or eat. If you follow the answer, you become that healthy person.
* Habits matter not because they help you to achieve some outcomes(goals) but because that change your identity and, therefore,
you achieve whatever is expected/normal for your identity.

# Ch3 Build better habits
All habits proceed through stages:
1. Cue: you meet some external or intrnal trigger and it starts habit execution.
2. Craving: high motivation to make some action for a reword.
3. Response: your action for which you supposed to get a reward.
4. Reward: some outcome that is supposed to justify the response and satisfy the craving.

Having a habit means repeating this cycle over and over again. It is known as the habit loop.

How to create a habit:
1. Cue: make it obvious
2. Craving: make it attractive
3. Response: make it easy to do.
4. Make it satisfying

How to break a bad habit:
1. Cue: make it invisible(eg remove cigarettes from home).
2. Craving: Make it unattractive(eg print ugly adds on cigarette packs).
3. Response: make it difficult(eg make cigarettes expensive).
4. Reward: make it unsatisfying

-- Law 1: Make it obvious
# Ch5 Create new habits
Make a new habit obvious by:
1. Implementation intention: say out load the formula "I will [BEHAVIOUR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]".
2. Habit stacking: add a new habit to the existing one. The old one should trigger the new one.
Example: 
3. after [Current habit], I will [new habit].

# Ch6 Environment matters
To trigger good behaviours make your cues visible. Example: to drink more water,
prepare and place water bottles around your apartment.

Interesting observation: habits are easier to change in a new environment where there are no old triggers.

It is hard to work from home because you cannot concentrate in the place where you have fun, do family activities etc.
Every habit must have a home. Divide your apartment into zones: chair only for reading, laptop only for working,
bed only for sleeping. Otherwise, you will always be distracted. For example, it is hard to work on laptop on which
you play video games.

# Ch7 Secret of self-control
People with good self-control are not neccessirely better off than people without. People with good self-control are diceplined
and can structure their life in the way that they do not have to resist temptations of bad habits.

You can break a bad habit(smoking) but you will not forget it. Avoid cues(triggers) at all cost. Make your cues invisible.

-- Law 2: Make it attractive
# Ch8 How to make a habit irresistable
The more attractive the opportunity is, the more habit forming it is.

Dopamine(дофамін) - organic chemical that is released by the brain when we want smth(motivated to do smth).

Temptation bundling - connection action you want(check the news) to do with an action you NEED to do(exercising).

# Ch9

We imitate behaviours of three social groups:
1. the close(family and friends)
2. the many(the tribe where we live)
3. the powerful(those with status and prestige).

Good way to get good habits is to join a culture with values and behaviours that you want to have.

# Ch10
Make bad habits as unattractive as possible. Find and say out load reasons why playing video games is bad and how it leads you nowhere.

Motivation ritual - start a little ritual before you make smth you love. Then repeat this ritual before making smth that is difficult and 
you will find it easier to do.

# Ch11

Progress could be done in two ways:
1. Being in motion - slow, a lot of contemplating, making ideas but not implementing.
2. Being in action - try as many things as possible.

Try to make as many actions as possible. Actions deliver result from which you can learn and improve.

-- Law 3: Make it easy
# Ch12

Make GOOD(and complex) habits as easy, as possible: make preparations in advance. For example, if you want to read tomorrow, 
setup you working space, bring water, cleanup room already today.
Design your environments and habits to be as simple and automatic as possible.

Make BAD habits as difficult, as possible. For example, if you play to much video games, you could do this after you finish playing:
1. hide console in another room.
2. Remove batteries from controllers
3. Unplug TV
So make it as hard as possible to do this bad habit again. These small things add up and ruin your motivation next time.

# Ch13

Two-minute rule: every new habit must start small and easy. It must be done under 2 minutes AT FIRST. Later you can increase the time
(for example, start with 10 push-ups and gradually increase)

# Ch14
Use tech and services as much as possible to automate your tasks. You need time to focus on new challenges.

Make execution of you bad habits extremely difficult(eg leave your wallet at home if you do not want ot overeat in a mall). 
Author refers to it as behaviour locking - making hard decision in present that will influence my future behavior.

-- Law 4: Make it satisfying
# Ch 15
Only habits that are IMMEDIATELY satisfying will last and repeat. This is a problem because usually bad habits are IMMEDIATELY
satisfying(eg. entertainment, junk food, alcohol) and good habits are satisfying on in THE LONG RUN. That is why good habits do
not stick to people.
What you should do is to award yourself IMMEDIATELY after making a good habit(eg. go for a walk, eat a fruit, go for a run). 

The previous 3 behaviour laws make sure that a habit is performed but only the "make it satisfying" law makes sure that the behavior will
be repeated.

# Ch 16
"All or nothing" attitude is a common mistake. You do not do smth because you tell yourself: do it perfectly or do not do it at all.
That is a mistake. It is important to show up every day to confirm your identity. Yes, there are some bad days when you do not perform as well
as you thought but you must be consistent continue doing your thing.

Never miss a routine event twice. If you miss smth once, make sure to do it next time. If you miss once, it is a coincidence.
If you miss twice - this is a begning of a habit.

# Ch17
Problem with bad habits that they serve some need NOW but the actual punishment is coming much later(eg smoking). To quit a bad habit
come up with an IMMEDIATE penalty if you do a bad habit. If you are immediately penalized, the habit becomes not satisfying and 
you are less likely to repeat it.

Author suggests to find an accountability body. He reasons that we always want to show us in the best light in public. Immediate
punishment of disappointing your accountability body should keep us away from a bad habit.

Author also suggests to make a habit contract: add some monetary cost for breaching bad habit or not making a good habit. 

# Ch18
Maximize your success odds by choosing the field of competition you are good at/or like.
Play/choose a game that favours your streanth.

# Ch19
The biggest threat to success is boredom. Once you become good at smth you get bored and you want to change
and start learning cycle again. Stick to smth that you can do best and what makes you happy. Successful people
overcome this boredome and continue doing the same thing every day even if they are bored with it. Showing up
each day is very important.
You cannot be endlessly fascinated for doing the same thing over-and-over again. But you need to do the thing for
success. You have to fall in love with boredom.

Anyone can work when he is motivated. The ability to keep on working even without motivation is what sets
professionals apart from amatures.
