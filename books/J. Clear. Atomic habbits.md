# Atomic habits
# Ch1 Power of atomic habits
* 1% rule - make one percent progress every day. Make sure to do smth every day that makes you 1% better.
You will progress in a compounded matter, per year you will have more than 365% because you do smth every day.
* Be patient. Small changes often make no result until certain threshold. 
* Forget about setting goals. Focus on your system and you will get results. You are only as good as your system.

# Ch2 How habits shape your identity
* Three levels of layers of behaviour change:
- outcome: you set some goals and achieve them. But you do not change yourself
- process: you change the system how you operate to achieve outcomes.
- identity: change you beliefs. Ask yourself what kind of person gets the goals(finance, relationships etc) that you want?
Become that person and you will achieve the outcomes automatically.
* Your identity are your habits and vice verse. Every action you take is some sort of confirmation of your identity. If you 
take only good actions, you will start believing that you are a good person. For example, ask yourself all the time
what would a healthy person do or eat. If you follow the answer, you become that healthy person.
* Habits matter not because they help you to achieve some outcomes(goals) but because that change your identity and, therefore,
you achieve whatever is expected/normal for your identity.

# Ch3 Build better habits
All habits proceed through stages:
1. Cue: you meet some external or intrnal trigger and it starts habit execution.
2. Craving: high motivation to make some action for a reword.
3. Response: your action for which you supposed to get a reward.
4. Reward: some outcome that is supposed to justify the response and satisfy the craving.

Having a habit means repeating this cycle over and over again. It is known as the habit loop.

How to create a habit:
1. Cue: make it obvious
2. Craving: make it attractive
3. Response: make it easy to do.
4. Make it satisfying

How to break a bad habit:
1. Cue: make it invisible(eg remove cigarettes from home).
2. Craving: Make it unattractive(eg print ugly adds on cigarette packs).
3. Response: make it difficult(eg make cigarettes expensive).
4. Reward: make it unsatisfying
