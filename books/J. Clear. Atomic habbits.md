# Atomic habits

* 1% rule - make one percent progress every day. Make sure to do smth every day that makes you 1% better.
You will progress in a compounded matter, per year you will have more than 365% because you do smth every day.

# Ch2
* Three levels of layers of behaviour change:
- outcome: you set some goals and achieve them. But you do not change yourself
- process: you change the system how you operate to achieve outcomes.
- identity: change you beliefs. Ask yourself what kind of person gets the goals(finance, relationships etc) that you want?
Become that person and you will achieve the outcomes automatically.

* Your identity are your habits and vice verser. Every action you take is some sort of confirmation of your identity. If you 
take only good actions, you will start believing that you are a good person. For example, ask yourself all the time
what would a healthy person do or eat. If you follow the answer, you become that healthy person.

* Habits matter not because they help you to achieve some outcomes(goals) but because that change your identity and, therefore,
you achieve whatever is expected/normal for your identity.
