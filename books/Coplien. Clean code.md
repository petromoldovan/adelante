If you start having bad code, it incentivises others to make more bad code.

Clean code is:
- elegant and efficient. Straightforward and makes it hard for bugs to hide.
- error handling is complete
- does one thing well
- simple and direct. Reads like a well written prose
- when you read it, you feel that person cared about it
- has meaningfull names
- is easy to enhance by other devs
- runs all tests
- contains no duplicates
- minimizes number of entities such as classes, functions etc
- when you read it, you read what you expected
- code makes the language look like it was meant for the problem
