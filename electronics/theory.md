V - voltage (напруга)
I - current (сила струму)
R - resistence (опір)

Current is generated by electroc field.
Electron are moving from - to +.

electro current vs conventional current
key difF:
Electron Current: Negative to positive (electrons move).
Conventional Current: Positive to negative movement of the wholes that are left when electrons jump from left to the right(positive charge flow assumed).
Whole current is wholes that are left by electrons(negatively charged) as the move from left(-) to right(+)

Silicon can be easily doped with other elements (like phosphorus or boron) to modify its electrical properties. This is crucial for creating p-type(positive charged) and n-type semiconductors used in electronic devices.

# Current and voltage

Current - amount of charge q(electrons) tjat passes poimt p as a function of time. Or mathematically: current is amount or charge per unit of time.
1A(ampere) = 1c(coulumb) of charge moved through a points per second

Voltage point with + is inducing current(for example +5A) to Voltage point with -.

Watt = Voltage * current.
Example hair dryier
220V*5A = 1100Watt

Voltage is a preassure used to move current.
V = 1J(juel) / 1c(coulumn)
1J of energy must be used to move 1 unit of charge through a potential difference of voltage of 1V.

To generate voltage use:

1. Batteries
2. Magnetic fields
3. Photo electric effect

Another way to calculate voltage
V = Amp \* Resistence(in Ohms)

# AC/DC

AC and DC are two types of electrical current.

## AC

Alternating current (AC) is a type of electrical current in which the flow of electric charge periodically reverses direction. In an AC circuit, the voltage varies in a sinusoidal pattern, which means it changes continuously over time in a smooth, repetitive wave.

- Direction: The current flows in both directions, alternating back and forth.
- Voltage: The voltage level oscillates between positive and negative values.
- Frequency: AC is characterized by its frequency, which is the number of cycles it completes per second. The standard frequency in most of the world is 50 Hz, while in North America, it is 60 Hz.
- Common Uses: AC is commonly used for power distribution in homes and industries because it is more efficient for transmitting power over long distances. Typical sources of AC include power plants and household electrical outlets.

Rms(root mean squer) provides a measure of the average magnitude of the values in the dataset. It is used to give some magnitud to alternating currents (AC). It is the number written on wall socket.

Rms(root mean squer is smth written on wall socket) = VoltageOnOutlet * 2*sqrt(2)
Example: 120V / 0.3535 = 339V

If signal is symetrical then the voltage range is from +169 to -169 which is way more than it says on socket - 120V.

## DC

Direct Current (DC) is a type of electrical current where the electric charge flows in a single, consistent direction. Unlike Alternating Current (AC), which periodically reverses direction, DC maintains a constant direction of flow, making it straightforward and stable.

- Direction: The flow of electrons is unidirectional, meaning it moves in one direction from the negative to the positive terminal.
- Voltage: The voltage in a DC circuit is constant, unlike AC where the voltage fluctuates. This means that the potential difference between the two terminals remains the same over time.
- Sources: Common sources of DC include batteries, solar panels, and DC power supplies. Many electronic devices, such as laptops, smartphones, and LEDs, operate on DC.
- Applications: DC is widely used in low-voltage applications and electronic circuits. It's also used in applications requiring stable and constant voltage, such as in charging batteries, electrochemical processes, and some types of motors.
- Transmission: While DC is less efficient than AC for long-distance power transmission, high-voltage direct current (HVDC) is used in some specific applications for long-distance and underwater cables due to its efficiency over long distances without the need for synchronization as required by AC systems.

# Ohm's Law

Voltage = current*Resistance
Or
V = I*R

# Power

Power is amount of charge that passes through an element in one time unite multiplied by voltage.
dw=V*dq/dt
OR
P=V*I=voltage\*current(only for DC)

Instantanious power(for AC)
Pmax = Vmax*Imax*cos(theta)

where cos(theta) is cosinus from difference in phase angles(lead or lag) of current and voltage.

# Descrete components

## Resisotor

Resistors are used to limit the amount of current that can flow through a circuit. For example, in a simple LED circuit, a resistor is placed in series with the LED to prevent too much current from passing through and damaging the LED. Resistors are characterized by their resistance, which is measured in ohms (Ω).
