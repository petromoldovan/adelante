Current is generated by electroc field.
Electron are moving from - to +.

electro current vs conventional current
key difF:
Electron Current: Negative to positive (electrons move).
Conventional Current: Positive to negative movement of the wholes that are left when electrons jump from left to the right(positive charge flow assumed).
Whole current is wholes that are left by electrons(negatively charged) as the move from left(-) to right(+)

Silicon can be easily doped with other elements (like phosphorus or boron) to modify its electrical properties. This is crucial for creating p-type(positive charged) and n-type semiconductors used in electronic devices.

# Current and voltage

Current - amount of charge q(electrons) tjat passes poimt p as a function of time. Or mathematically: current is amount or charge per unit of time.
1A(ampere) = 1c(coulumb) of charge moved through a points per second

Voltage point with + is inducing current(for example +5A) to Voltage point with -.

Watt = Voltage * current.
Example hair dryier
220V*5A = 1100Watt

Voltage is a preassure used to move current.
V = 1J(juel) / 1c(coulumn)
1J of energy must be used to move 1 unit of charge through a potential difference of voltage of 1V.

To generate voltage use:

1. Batteries
2. Magnetic fields
3. Photo electric effect

Another way to calculate voltage
V = Amp \* Resistence(in Ohms)
