V - voltage (напруга)
I - current (сила струму)
R - resistence (опір)

Current is generated by electroc field.
Electron are moving from - to +.

electro current vs conventional current
key difF:
Electron Current: Negative to positive (electrons move).
Conventional Current: Positive to negative movement of the wholes that are left when electrons jump from left to the right(positive charge flow assumed).
Whole current is wholes that are left by electrons(negatively charged) as the move from left(-) to right(+)

Silicon can be easily doped with other elements (like phosphorus or boron) to modify its electrical properties. This is crucial for creating p-type(positive charged) and n-type semiconductors used in electronic devices.

# Current and voltage

Current - amount of charge q(electrons) that passes point p as a function of time. Or mathematically: current is amount or charge per unit of time.
1A(ampere) = 1c(coulumb) of charge moved through a points per second

Voltage point with + is inducing current(for example +5A) to Voltage point with -.

Watt = Voltage * current.
Example hair dryier
220V*5A = 1100Watt = 1kWatt

Voltage is a preassure used to move current.
V = 1J(juel) / 1c(coulumn)
1J of energy must be used to move 1 unit of charge through a potential difference of voltage of 1V.

To generate voltage use:

1. Batteries
2. Magnetic fields
3. Photo electric effect

Another way to calculate voltage
V = Amp\*Resistence(in Ohms)

# Wire grounding

Think of grounding like having a safety escape route for electricity. If something goes wrong with the electrical system, like a wire breaks or something short-circuits, the electricity needs a safe place to go. Instead of running through your body or causing a fire, the electricity is directed safely into the ground, where it can disperse harmlessly.

- sign called anode(аноуд)

* side called cathode(касоуд)

# AC/DC

AC and DC are two types of electrical current.

## AC

Alternating current (AC) is a type of electrical current in which the flow of electric charge periodically reverses direction. In an AC circuit, the voltage varies in a sinusoidal pattern, which means it changes continuously over time in a smooth, repetitive wave.

- Direction: The current flows in both directions, alternating back and forth.
- Voltage: The voltage level oscillates between positive and negative values.
- Frequency: AC is characterized by its frequency, which is the number of cycles it completes per second. The standard frequency in most of the world is 50 Hz, while in North America, it is 60 Hz.
- Common Uses: AC is commonly used for power distribution in homes and industries because it is more efficient for transmitting power over long distances. Typical sources of AC include power plants and household electrical outlets.

Rms(root mean squer) provides a measure of the average magnitude of the values in the dataset. It is used to give some magnitud to alternating currents (AC). It is the number written on wall socket.

Rms(root mean squer is smth written on wall socket) = VoltageOnOutlet * 2*sqrt(2)
Example: 120V / 0.3535 = 339V

If signal is symetrical then the voltage range is from +169 to -169 which is way more than it says on socket - 120V.

## DC

Direct Current (DC) is a type of electrical current where the electric charge flows in a single, consistent direction. Unlike Alternating Current (AC), which periodically reverses direction, DC maintains a constant direction of flow, making it straightforward and stable.

- Direction: The flow of electrons is unidirectional, meaning it moves in one direction from the negative to the positive terminal.
- Voltage: The voltage in a DC circuit is constant, unlike AC where the voltage fluctuates. This means that the potential difference between the two terminals remains the same over time.
- Sources: Common sources of DC include batteries, solar panels, and DC power supplies. Many electronic devices, such as laptops, smartphones, and LEDs, operate on DC.
- Applications: DC is widely used in low-voltage applications and electronic circuits. It's also used in applications requiring stable and constant voltage, such as in charging batteries, electrochemical processes, and some types of motors.
- Transmission: While DC is less efficient than AC for long-distance power transmission, high-voltage direct current (HVDC) is used in some specific applications for long-distance and underwater cables due to its efficiency over long distances without the need for synchronization as required by AC systems.

# Ohm's Law

Voltage = current*Resistance
Or
V = I*R

# Power

Power is amount of charge that passes through an element in one time unite multiplied by voltage.
dw=V*dq/dt
OR
P=V*I=voltage\*current(only for DC)

Instantanious power(for AC)
Pmax = Vmax*Imax*cos(theta)

where cos(theta) is cosinus from difference in phase angles(lead or lag) of current and voltage.

# Descrete components

## Resisotor

Purpose: decrese voltage
Resistors are used to limit the amount of current that can flow through a circuit. For example, in a simple LED circuit, a resistor is placed in series with the LED to prevent too much current from passing through and damaging the LED. Resistors are characterized by their resistance, which is measured in ohms (Ω).

Calculations in Ohms:
Series of resistors - sum
Parallel resistors - product over sum

## Potentiometer

Purpose: decrese voltage
It is like a variable resistor. You can configure its resistance value.

## Capacitor

Purpose: stores charge
Purpose2: filtering. You can filterout DC current and pass only AC forward.
Can be polarised and not polarised. Polarised must be inserted in curcuit correctly with regards to anode and cathode, otherwise capacitor might explode.
Electrolytic capacitors are bad, do not use.

Calculations in Farads(F):
Series of capacitors - product over sum
Parallel capacitors - sum

Circuit with capacitor component - RC circuit.

# Impedence
impedence - how a component resists/reacts to current flow.
Reactance - charge that is pushed back against the current flow by the capacitor. We also call it impedence of capacitor.

## Inductor

Purpose: stores charge
An inductor is a passive electronic component that stores energy in the form of a magnetic field when electrical current flows through it. It typically consists of a coil of wire wound around a core, which can be made of air, iron, or other materials that enhance its magnetic properties.

Circuit with inductor component - LC circuit.

## Transformers

Purpose: Changes voltage up or down.
A transformer is an electrical device that transfers electrical energy between two or more circuits through electromagnetic induction. It is used to increase (step up) or decrease (step down) the voltage levels in power systems.

## Diode

Purpose: semiconductor that allows flow of current in one direction only.
Structure and Function:

- P-N Junction: A diode is made from a piece of semiconductor material, typically silicon, which is doped to create two regions: a p-type (positive) and an n-type (negative) region. The interface where these two regions meet is called a P-N junction.
- Forward Bias: When a positive voltage is applied to the p-type side (anode) and a negative voltage to the n-type side (cathode), the diode is in "forward bias," allowing current to flow through it.
- Reverse Bias: When the polarity is reversed, the diode is in "reverse bias," and ideally, no current flows (except a tiny leakage current).

### Selected diode types

1. Rectifier Diodes:
   Purpose: Convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC).
   Use: In power supplies to provide DC voltage from an AC source.
2. Zener Diodes:
   Purpose: Allow current to flow in the reverse direction when a specific reverse voltage is reached.
   Use: used to limit amout of voltage going to a specific component: indicators, displays, and lighting.
3. Schottky Diodes:
   Purpose: Have a lower forward voltage drop and faster switching speed.
   Use: In high-speed circuits and power rectification.
4. Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs):
   Purpose: Emit light when forward biased.
   Use: Indicators, displays, and lighting.

# Transistors

PNP(points in) and NPM(points out)
Consists of three leads:
Emitter
Base
Collector

Base must get some charge so that current starts flowing through Emitter. Otherwise, current is flowing through Collector.

# MOSFEITS

Better that transistors.


# Hertz
Hertz (Hz) is a unit of frequency that measures the number of cycles per second of a periodic phenomenon. It is used primarily in the context of waves and vibrations, such as sound waves, electromagnetic waves (including radio waves and light), and alternating electrical currents.
