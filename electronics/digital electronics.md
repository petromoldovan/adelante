# Clocks
Almost every computer system has a clock component. Clock generates a stable digital signal of high and low that computer system uses to synchronize all its components. Data from all other components is typically read and processed at clock phases(rises or falls).

# Logic families
Author recommends low cost and performant LVC or LVA families.

# Decoder
Component that takes in few signals and outputs more data.

# Digital Multiplexer
Takes in few signals but forwards only one of them.
