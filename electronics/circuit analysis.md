# Kirchhoff Current Law

Amount of current that is entering a node is equal to amount of current that leaves the node(even though the exit might be split into multiple branches)

# Kirchhoff Voltage Law

The same. Sum of voltage in closed loop is zero. Voltage starts with some value(eg 5V) and drops to 0 by the end of the loop.

# Serial resistance

If resistors are on the same line, you just up their resistance.

# Parallel resistance

If you have parallel resistors do:
R1\*R2/(R1+R2)
it is called Product over sum.
Result will be smaller then the lowest resistor. You merge parallel resistors into one.

# Voltage at resistor
V=I*R

OR transformed version of the formula above:

Voltage at resistor = Resistance at resistor itself * Total Voltage/Sum of all resistors in Ohms
