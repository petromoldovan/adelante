# Agile development
Software development methodology that emphasizes flexibility, team collaboration and 
iterative approach. There are many small development itterations(sprints)
after each one of them, there is a deployable output. Agile development
forces cooperation of all stakeholders during sprint planning.

# Scrum
- scrum is about routine meeting, like daily, spring planning, retro.
- closed(no new tickets after sprint start) sprints of defined length
- tickets are planned for the sprint and no new tickets emerge
- tasks are prioritised for each sprint in the sprint planning
- uses board to visualize progress(although some resources say it is more of a kanban feature).

# Kanban
- tickets are organized according priority in backlog. If developer is
done with the current ticket, he should pick the next ticket from backlog with
the highest priority.
- ticket is added to backlog and prioritised after team discussion(usually in daily)
- no sprints or designed ceremonies. It is up to team.
- kanban board(in progress, review, done)
