# Software design principles/patterns

1. Layered Architecture. Separate software in different layers(business, presentation, network etc). Each
   layer communicates with the one above or below.
2. Microservices Architecture. Pattern divides software in small, independent services that perform
   specific business function.
3. Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture. Pattern separates the software into three components:
   the model (data), the view (user interface), and the controller (business logic). The model represents
   the data, the view displays the data, and the controller processes the user input.
4. Event-Driven Architecture. Components communicate with each other by producing and consuming events.
5. Service-Oriented Architecture. Software is developed with range of separate abstract services that could
   be used by other applications. Similar microservices but the functionality of services is much
   broader.
6. API Gateway architecture. Pattern that provides a single point of entry for external clients to
   access multiple APIs.
