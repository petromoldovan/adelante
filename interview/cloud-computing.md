# Cloud computing

Cloud computing is a model of delivering computer services(storage, processing power, software etc) 
to a user over internet. Users can access a shared pool of resources that can be scaled up or down with
minimal effort. Users can match their business needs with minimal management effort.

Three service models of cloud computing:
1. Infrastructure as a service(IaaS): provides users with access to resources(storage, computing power, networking).
Examples: aws, MS Azure, google cloud platform.
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS): provides users with platform to run and develop applications without overhead of
maintaining the underlying infrastructure.
Examples: Heroku, Google App Engine, MS Azure
3. Software as a Service (SaaS): provides users with access to complete applications.
Example: Dropbox, Salesforce and Google Workspace.
